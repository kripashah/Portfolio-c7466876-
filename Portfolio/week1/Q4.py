# In a long career for Yorkshire, Geoffrey Boycott played 609 matches, batted 1014 times, was not out 162 times, and scored 48426 runs. Write a program to calculate and display Boycott's batting average. Note: A batting average is the number of runs scored divided by the number of completed innings (i.e. the total times batted minus the times not out).
