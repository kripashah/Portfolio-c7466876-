# A kindly teacher wishes to distribute a tub of sweets between her pupils. She will first count the sweets and then divide them according to how many pupils attend that day. Write a program that will tell the teacher how many sweets to give to each pupil, and how many she will have left over.

# Distribute sweets and get the results
